CoffeeScript-nano
=================

CoffeeScript syntax highlighting in GNU Nano.

Move along
----------

coffeescript-nano has now been merged into [serialhex's nano-highlight repositor](https://github.com/serialhex/nano-highlight). I highly recommend you get your copy from there, because it includes a boatload of other useful highlighting files.


Installing
----------

To install for the whole system, put coffee.nanorc in /usr/share/nano and add the following lines to your /etc/nanorc
```
## CoffeeScript
include "/usr/share/nano/coffee.nanorc"
```

or if you'd like to have it for just yourself, you can put coffee.nanorc anywhere, and put similar lines in your ~/.nanorc
